        singer gained him the reputation of a romantic hero.[8][9]

        Vijay began the new millennium with critically and commercially successful films such as Kushi and
        Priyamaanavale.[10][11] The following year, he appeared in three films: Friends, Badri and Shahjahan. All three
        were box office successes;[12][13] barring successful ventures Thamizhan,[13] Youth and Bagavathi (all three
        released in 2002),[14][15] his subsequent films Vaseegara and Pudhiya Geethai were released. While Vaseegara was
        a moderate success and received praise for his comic-timing,[16] Puthiya Geethai received negative reviews and
        underperformed at the box office.[17][18][19] The success of his masala film Thirumalai (2003),[20] changed his
        on-screen persona to that of an action hero.[21] He appeared next as a kabaddi player in Ghilli (2004), which
        went on to become the most commercially successful Tamil film of the year.[4][22] His performance as a
        sword-smith in the masala film Thirupaachi (2005) earned him a special prize at the Tamil Nadu State Film
        Awards.[23][24] He continued to achieve commercial success with Sivakasi (2005) and Pokkiri (2007).[25][26]
        Barring Vettaikaaran and Kuruvi's box office successes,[27] his subsequent releases Azhagiya Tamil Magan (2007),
        where he played dual roles for the first time in his career,[28] and Villu (2009) were average
        successes;[29][30][31] his 50th film, Sura (2010), managed to recover only its production cost.[32]

        In 2011 Vijay's career prospects improved after he was praised for his role as a bodyguard in Kaavalan, which
        had a 100-day theatrical run and was a box office hit.[33][34] Velayudham in which, he appeared as a masked
        superhero was commercially successful worldwide.[35] The following year he appeared in two films: as a college
        student in Nanban and an army officer in Thuppakki.[36][37] His performances in both films received positive
        critical feedback.[38] He followed that with Thalaivaa (2013) and the multi-starrer Jilla (2014) which was
        commercially successful.[39][40] He teamed up with Murugadoss again for the action film Kaththi (2014). The
        film, which had Vijay playing dual roles as a thief and an idealist, became one of the highest-grossing Tamil
        films of that year; his performances earned him critics praise.[41][42] In his next film, fantasy Puli (2015),
        he featured again in dual roles;[43] it was an overseas success.[44] The following year, he played a police
        officer in Atlee's Theri to mixed reviews.[45] The film had one of the biggest openings in Tamil cinema and was
        a major commercial success.[46][47][48] Vijay's performance won him South Indian International Movie
        Awards.[49][50] He played triple roles for the first time in Mersal (2017).[51] In addition to garnering a UK
        Award for Best Actor,[52][53] the film became a box office success.[54] Vijay earned critical acclaim for Sarkar
        (2018).[55][56] He also starred in films Bigil (2019), Master (2021), Beast (2022), Varisu and Leo (both 2023),
        all of which garnered mixed reviews but were commercially successful in the box office, with the latter becoming
        the highest-grossing film of his career.[57][58] Vijay is an Indian actor, playback singer and politician who

        Vijay began the new millennium with critically and commercially successful films such as Kushi and
        Priyamaanavale.[10][11] The following year, he appeared in three films: Friends, Badri and Shahjahan. All three
        were box office successes;[12][13] barring successful ventures Thamizhan,[13] Youth and Bagavathi (all three
        released in 2002),[14][15] his subsequent films Vaseegara and Pudhiya Geethai were released. While Vaseegara was
        a moderate success and received praise for his comic-timing,[16] Puthiya Geethai received negative reviews and
        underperformed at the box office.[17][18][19] The success of his masala film Thirumalai (2003),[20] changed his
        on-screen persona to that of an action hero.[21] He appeared next as a kabaddi player in Ghilli (2004), which
        went on to become the most commercially successful Tamil film of the year.[4][22] His performance as a
        sword-smith in the masala film Thirupaachi (2005) earned him a special prize at the Tamil Nadu State Film
        Awards.[23][24] He continued to achieve commercial success with Sivakasi (2005) and Pokkiri (2007).[25][26]
        Barring Vettaikaaran and Kuruvi's box office successes,[27] his subsequent releases Azhagiya Tamil Magan (2007),
        where he played dual roles for the first time in his career,[28] and Villu (2009) were average
        successes;[29][30][31] his 50th film, Sura (2010), managed to recover only its production cost.[32]

        In 2011 Vijay's career prospects improved after he was praised for his role as a bodyguard in Kaavalan, which
        had a 100-day theatrical run and was a box office hit.[33][34] Velayudham in which, he appeared as a masked
        superhero was commercially successful worldwide.[35] The following year he appeared in two films: as a college
        student in Nanban and an army officer in Thuppakki.[36][37] His performances in both films received positive
        critical feedback.[38] He followed that with Thalaivaa (2013) and the multi-starrer Jilla (2014) which was
        commercially successful.[39][40] He teamed up with Murugadoss again for the action film Kaththi (2014). The
        film, which had Vijay playing dual roles as a thief and an idealist, became one of the highest-grossing Tamil
        films of that year; his performances earned him critics praise.[41][42] In his next film, fantasy Puli (2015),
        he featured again in dual roles;[43] it was an overseas success.[44] The following year, he played a police
        officer in Atlee's Theri to mixed reviews.[45] The film had one of the biggest openings in Tamil cinema and was
        a major commercial success.[46][47][48] Vijay's performance won him South Indian International Movie
        Awards.[49][50] He played triple roles for the first time in Mersal (2017).[51] In addition to garnering a UK
        Award for Best Actor,[52][53] the film became a box office success.[54] Vijay earned critical acclaim for Sarkar
        (2018).[55][56] He also starred in films Bigil (2019), Master (2021), Beast (2022), Varisu and Leo (both 2023),
        all of which garnered mixed reviews but were commercially successful in the box office, with the latter becoming
        the highest-grossing film of his career.[57][58] Vijay is an Indian actor, playback singer and politician who
        works in Tamil cinema. He made his cinematic debut in 1984 with Vetri, directed by his father, Chandrasekhar.[1]
        After appearing in Chandrasekhar's films as a child artist, Vijay made his debut as a lead actor with Naalaiya
        Theerpu (1992) at the age of 18.[1] He followed it with a role opposite Vijayakanth in Senthoorapandi (1993).[2]
        Vijay went on to play lead roles in his father's directorial ventures such as Rasigan (1994) and Deva
        (1995).[2][3] Most of those films were successful commercially.[4][5]</div>
